# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

In this impactful project, I'm focusing on building a robust model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By exploring algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, I aim to enhance my skills in anomaly detection. This project provides a practical understanding of how machine learning can contribute to real-world issues, particularly in ensuring financial security.
